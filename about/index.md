## What is this red bird thing?

It's a modification / adaptation / trace (svg form) of the first digital picture I ever took.

The bird is a *Cardinalis cardinalis* (Northern Red Cardinal) from Eastern Tennessee.

I've been using it for my online presence for a very long time, making new versions of it every so often.
