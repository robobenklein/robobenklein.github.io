TLDR:

Here's what I am:
 * a Highschool Senior.
 * the Lead Programmer for the L&N STEMpunks FRC Robotics Team.
 * a Team Fortress 2 UGC Steel Medic for *Fate's Error*.
 * the Founder and Owner of Robosane.
 * a younger than average Systems Administrator.
 * an Ubuntu Addict.
 * a hacker.
 * a Web Designer. (HTML CSS JS jQuery Joomla)
 * a Programmer in Python, Java, Javascript, Shell or Bash, C++, PHP, Ruby, Fish, and maybe some others I'm not thinking about right now.
 * a community leader.
 * and a human.

And here's what I am *not*:
 * a Windows Enthusiast.
 * an OSX user.
 * a sports fan.
 * a historian.
 * a mathematician.
 * interested in politics.
 * interested in philosophy.
 * and everything else that isn't me.
