## Why "Unhexium"?

**Unhexium** is the name of the very first laptop I bought with my own money. It's from the naming scheme I've been using for all my laptops since, Unseptium, Unoctium, etc.

Unhexium is an important name to me because it's the first machine on which I ran Ubuntu as my primary OS and never since ran a proprietary OS on my personal machine.

Most people have a site like <name>.io or something... but robobenklein.??? just sounds really dumb for me to type and people already have a problem spelling my last name, not to mention how many times I've been called Rob because of that name.

## What is this red bird thing?

It's a modification / adaptation / trace (svg form) of the first digital picture I ever took.

The bird is a *Cardinalis cardinalis* (Northern Red Cardinal) from Eastern Tennessee.

I've been using it for my online presence for a very long time, making new versions of it every so often.
