It was time to say goodbye to the monolithic beast that is the Dell 4220 cabinet.

I loved it, it was an excellent cabinet, in not such an excellent situation.

To be honest, I never came close to filling it, at most I only ever had 30U of equipment in it, and being the 42U tall box that it is, there's no way it'll make it when I move residences. It was hard enough squeezing it through the doorframe of my workshop with less than an inch of vertical clearance to spare.

So in it's stead, I went out and bought a new cabinet. After weeks of research and asking around, I decided on the Sysracks 18U, 39" deep SRF 18.6.10 rack enclosure.


It certainly wasn't as cheap as an open-frame 4-post, but considering the environment I run it in I definitely needed an enclosure to manage airflow and avoid the side effects of animal cohabitants.

Upon arrival I received 5 large, heavy boxes, which I could just barely move myself. Of course, going up or down stairs is a two-person life for safety's sake.

# First assembly attempt

Unpacking all the boxes I noticed a red flag: one was marked for a different cabinet model that was a shorter depth. I called Sysracks that day to mention it, and was told to go ahead and try assembly with the parts on hand since they were modular.

I go to about the third box of 5 before I knew for sure that the part was wrong, all I had to do was take the measuring tape from my R420 server to the enclosure's side walls to find out it was too short.

So I send back an email, and a long process gets delayed further by COVID shipping restrictions.

# Getting the right parts

Before even thinking about shipping the wrong parts back first, Sysracks ships a whole new set of 3 packages for the correct model. Thus I'll have the best chance in case I find any other problems with the packages.

Shipping during these times of course took a good while longer, meaning I had more than just a bit of workspace occupied by the in-progress rack build. Luckily nothing critical happened with any of the running systems then.

# Full Assembly

I was fairly impressed with the simplicity of the construction of the enclosure. I did have to follow instructions, but just to choose the correct set of bolts and nuts.

I like the simpler construction because it means I'm able to take it apart and transport it, reassemble and setup without needing to spend more than an hour fitting pieces together.

While some parts were fairly heavy, no individual part was a two person lift, in fact each individual piece could be lifted with one arm which will make disassembly, transport, and reassembly much easier.

The only delicate part of the whole process was the glass front door, which is basically a large single glass pane with some metal edges glued to the two sides. I was extra careful not to leave it sitting on concrete without padding underneath, in fear of how easily the bottom and top edges would scratch.
