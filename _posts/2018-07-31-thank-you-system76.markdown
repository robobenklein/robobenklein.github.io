Two years later my System76 Oryx Pro **v1** is still running strong.

It's not just the regular cleaning or standard computer upkeep that's been keeping it alive so well - it's the amazing software support that System76 has provided throughout it's lifetime.

When I first got my laptop, I was already very happy with my purchase, and Linux *just worked* like I so desired.

Now, with two years of software and firmware updates from System76, my laptop is actually running just as well - if not better - than it was when I first received it.


Here's a short list of the features I've most appreciated from these software/firmware updates:

 - Nvidia Drivers
   - Switching between integrated Intel graphics and the dedicated GTX970M is now as simple as pressing a button and a quick reboot!
   - System76 has provided graphics drivers updates the whole time, with each update coming in without any issues or problems with graphics performance.
   - The System76 Nvidia CUDA PPA has been extremely useful, and it even helped a friend on a Dell XPS laptop get CUDA working!
   - The built-in screen in my laptop now runs at a 120hz native refresh rate thanks to the updates. (That's still with G-Sync on an IPS Panel!)

(Yes it looks like the hardware really does run faster than 60hz! I know because my other monitor is 144hz and I can spot the 60hz difference.)

 - Pop_OS!
   - Even though I'm not a direct user of their new Ubuntu-based operating system, I've found that a lot of their work there has been extremely beneficial to me even as I continue to boot the stock Ubuntu images.
   - The UI changes and clean design work makes the desktop feel much more modern again. This includes things like power profile switching, which I'm using on stock Ubuntu!

 - Intel IME
   - They wrote their own firmware update process to disable the Intel Management Engine!
   - Was really easy and well-integrated. Had no problems flashing the firmware.

These efforts are not to be taken lightly!

As a Reddit user [u/reconditus replied to one of my comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/93ao73/so_disheartened_about_all_the_issues_with_hybrid/e3bzi65) in r/linux:

> System76 deserve more recognition for the work they do. I recently bought the Sager-badged equivalent of the current-gen Oryx Pro (Clevo P955ER) because I had a ton of Amazon store credit burning a hole on my pocket, and Sager was available through them while System76 only sells direct. Big mistake. I have Linux running smoothly now, but only after wrestling through a handful of ACPI issues and lots of beating my head against a desk getting NVIDIA/Bumblebee to work properly (which it still only kind-of does). The TuxedoPC clevo-xsm-wmi module at least built cleanly, but even that could be a chore for someone not used to building from source.

## To the future

When I see a "Lifetime Support" offer on a product, I normally don't think too much of it. With System76, their support has been amazingly easy to work with!

I've had 4 open tickets on different topics, all of which were addressed timely and with good responses! They even helped me to diagnose a bad RAM stick even after the hardware warranty was over.

Since acquiring my Oryx Pro 2 years ago, many of my Linux using friends are now looking towards the options from System76. And when a friend bought a Gazelle for personal use, I knew I only wanted to further spread the word.
