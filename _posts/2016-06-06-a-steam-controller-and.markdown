You've probably heard that SteamOS is a Linux OS by now, and that means a lot for us Linux gamers.

Now that the number of Linux-compatible games is skyrocketing, and Steam is selling it's own hardware, I think you can guess what this review will tell.

Yes, I bought a Steam Controller.  
No, I do not regret it.
