UGC Highlander Season 17 is upon us!

This time we're ready!

This season Robosane is sponsoring a UGC Team, and we're ready to roll with 12 players currently on our roster. I'm playing medic as I usually am, with Solsane unexpectedly as demoman. You can see our full roster at [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZFYt-eXi0nGt4s-VMGwXApW9UBxf-BWwuIW0eVfyxec/](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZFYt-eXi0nGt4s-VMGwXApW9UBxf-BWwuIW0eVfyxec/) which is always the first up to date.

We performed our first scrim last night against PAL, and we did well after our first round, making a two win comeback before we called a time-based mercy. The round logs are at [http://logs.tf/1024498?highlight=76561198058317490](http://logs.tf/1024498?highlight=76561198058317490)

Hopefully this year we'll have a team that actually shows up for more than half the matches.
