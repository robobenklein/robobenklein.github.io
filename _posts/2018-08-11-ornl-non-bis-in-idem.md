It's been 3 years since my last writing on this subject.

After a great 3 years with [Oak Ridge National Laboratories](https://www.ornl.gov/), I feel it is time to share the experience again, as it has taken a drastically more interesting turn.

Of the many accomplishments from ORNL over this time, the one I feel most proud about is **Summit**, currently the fastest supercomputer in the world.

Since wrapping up my web project from my [first term with the OLCF as an intern](/work/ornl), I was brought in again for the next two summers (and during the school year) to continue working on an idea my boss had to save huge investments in watercooling Summit.


This new idea brought along a new project called *Summit Temperatures*, with the goal of saving major electricity costs on cooling and prolonging the life of Summit's computational components. By creating a smarter system for managing water flow, consumption prediction, and monitoring, we have the potential of saving both physical parts and electricity costs! (A significant chunk, considering Summit can consume up to 13MW of power, and output exactly that much heat!)

Working on this project has been a great experience, even though I've had new team members each summer, they've been great to work with. The technology stack in use on this project I also greatly enjoy working with. This includes Docker, Python, and RabbitMQ.

## A Turn Towards the Physical World

During the fall semester of 2017, I was actively involved with the IEEE Robotics team at UTK, where one of the graduate programmers noticed I had a relevant skillset in C++ and software development / DevOps practice, and he brought me into the **Manufacturing Demonstration Facility** to help out with the ORNL 3D printing slicer programs.

After that semester, I came back during the summer of 2018 full-time to manage the project while we had 6 other interns working on different parts of the project. During that time I was working heavily with Gitlab CI, multiplatform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) automated builds, and testing frameworks.

## Fall 2018

Now that I've been involved with both projects, I had both project PIs come back and ask me to continue working on their projects, so now I'm working part time split between the NCCS/OLCF and MDF jobs.

I plan to continue work forward with both projects, hopefully to completion. I shall write again when there's something worth writing about.
