Alright, I had my fair share of doubts to begin with, even though I am a happy System76 hardware owner, I still stuck to my tried and true Ubuntu.

That's recently changed: ever since I decided to have my new Darter Pro shipped with Pop!_OS 19.04, there's no going back anytime soon.

I'll talk about the laptop later, after I've had a chance to use it more. As for Pop!_OS I've already replaced Ubuntu on my desktop with it, and it's been awesome.

They've done a lot more than just throw a new skin on and integrate their laptop hardware, as I've used it I've seen how much under the hood has changed that seriously makes the average "just being a user" life so much more comfortable.


# The New to Linux User Experience

I've successfully converted more than a few people to GNU/Linux over the years, but Pop_OS! is the first time I've not had to worry about changing the OS at first install.

It gets installed and it's ready to use. In Ubuntu I would always have to apply my tweaks, fixes, etc to thing like the desktop, software repos, and replace snaps, but with Pop I just tell people to look at the Pop Shop for software first, and in most cases they're happy.

There's no need to do extra driver setup, tweaks, or anything really. The average computer user gets a system that "Just Works" and doesn't require me to give them command line instructions for every change. Even though Ubuntu was making strides with it's Software Center, installing snaps and missing popular programs were common issues that the everday user immediately noticed and were hindered by.

# My User Experience

In case you didn't notice already, I am strongly opinionated against Snap packages; Hence I am extremely glad that Pop_OS got rid of the snapd system entirely.
