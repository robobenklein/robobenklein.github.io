Alright, I had my fair share of doubts to begin with, even though I am a happy System76 hardware owner, I still stuck to my tried and true Ubuntu.

That's recently changed: ever since I decided to have my new Darter Pro shipped with Pop!_OS 19.04, there's no going back anytime soon.

I'll talk about the laptop later, after I've had a chance to use it more. As for Pop!_OS I've already replaced Ubuntu on my desktop with it, and it's been awesome.

They've done a lot more than just throw a new skin on and integrate their laptop hardware, as I've used it I've seen how much under the hood has changed that seriously makes the average "just being a user" life so much more comfortable.
