6 months ago (December 2018) I finally received my UHK after months of waiting.

After using it for just that long, I'm 100% convinced that the UHK is worth the asking price, probably more, and I'm happy that I got it at over $100 off the current price.

Currently priced at $350 USD it's definitely priced like the split ergonomic keyboard that it is, but what I think makes this one worth that is the open source, hackable nature of the keyboard.

Here's my thoughts after using it as an almost daily driver for 6 months,


# Typing

At first, I wasn't a complete believer in Kailh keyswitches, but they've held up very well and show no signs of losing their feel. Still prefer Cherry for the desktop fullsize keyboards at home, but on the go and around school I've still had a good experience with these switches.

For some reason, they offered Cherry Cherry Clear and Green, but only Kailh browns. Since I was planning on using this board to take notes in class, noise was a high priority.

After a month or two, the switches were still a bit loud to use for notes in quiet lectures, so I bought and installed some generic o-rings which helped to reduce the keycap to board noise, but the springback action was still tell-tale of a mechanical keyboard.

# Splitting

The #1 eye-catching feature is for sure the splitting action.

I pull it out of a carrying case in one piece, and it looks whole, then it "appears I just rip my keyboard in half" as one fellow student commented.

But the aesthetics of the keyboard are nothing compared to how much better my carpal tunnel syndrome improved since using the UHK in place of my laptop keyboard. In fact, the primary reason I bought the UHK was to deal with carpal tunnel and I'm impressed how I've recovered without losing any real productivity.
