Yet another one of my experiences trying to get something that works on Windows to work on Ubuntu.

I've been using TF2center.com quite a bit recently to get in some practice matches, but it's not as smooth a process as I want it to be. It took me awhile to get the `steam://` connect links working properly, but Mumble has been manual for the most part.
